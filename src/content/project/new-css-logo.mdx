Months ago I saw on social media that the
[CSS-Next community group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2023Nov/att-0002/CSS-Next_Community_Group.pdf),
(a part of the W3C) was asking the community to propose new logo for CSS. After some thoughs I already had an idea in
mind, so I decided to give it a shot and post it on the GitHub thread as a proposal, with many variants so people could
choose their favorite.

Months later, while I was in the airport waiting for my flight back home, I saw that the CSS-Next group had chosen my
proposal as the final version because it was the most voted one! It made me very happy and I quickly accepted the task
of preparing the final version in different formats, together with Adam Argyle from Google.

We iterated a lot creating many variants and versions on Figma, listening to the community feedback on Mastodon, Bluesky
and Twitter (now called X), and ended up with the final version that you can see at the end of this post.

The design includes many nods to CSS and web design:

- Subtle rounded corners, making the logo resemble a tooltip / eye dropper / popup element. Referencing two of the
  things that were once hard to style in pure CSS: rounded corners and popovers. Now thanks to new specs like
  [Anchor Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) and the HTML Popover
  API, that's easier than ever.
- The HTML/CSS version of the logo uses modern CSS features, like `font-variant` and `@container` queries.
- Uses known web colors, such as <span class="bg-[rebeccapurple] text-white p-1 font-mono">rebeccapurple</span> (final
  version) or <span class="bg-[hotpink] text-black p-1 font-mono">hotpink</span> (original proposal).
- It is timeless and accessible, and can work well in different formats.

It also had to meet the following criteria:

- Works well without color, in white and black.
- Works with and without a version number (contains enough space to fit one).
- It's legible and recognizable, in small and large sizes.
- It's recognizable by color and shape, even if the text is too small (e.g. 12px and below).
- It can be represented in both SVG and CSS-only formats.
- It works well with existing community logos (JS, WebAssembly, etc) and brands (like Typescript).

## Final version

In the final version we opted to use an Open Source font: [Dinish Condensed Heavy](https://github.com/playbeing/dinish).

The Working Group also preferred the <span class="bg-[rebeccapurple] text-white p-1 font-mono">rebeccapurple</span>
color over hotpink, another known web color but with a beautiful and
[meaningful story behind it](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/).

This shade of purple honors Rebecca Alison Meyer, the late daughter of Eric Meyer, a pioneer in web development.
Rebecca's love for purple and her vibrant spirit inspired the web community to memorialize her in 2014 by officially
naming `#663399` "rebeccapurple" in CSS. Initially proposed as 'beccapurple,' Eric shared that Rebecca, upon turning
six, preferred to be called 'Rebecca' instead of 'Becca,' leading to the name 'rebeccapurple.' Itâ€™s a symbol of love,
loss, and the unbreakable ties that bind us, even across the vastness of the web.

Fast forward to today, the new CSS logo carries this legacy forward. Itâ€™s not just a design refresh - itâ€™s a beacon of
community, empathy, and the humanity within tech. A world where we celebrate progress, but never forget the stories that
shape us.

After a [popular vote](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105#issuecomment-2445341089), and also considering
blue colors, the community chose `rebeccapurple` with 420+ votes in favor.

Special thanks to [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/) for helping me with the different iterations of the logo, with the
HTML/CSS version, and helping with the community feedback and final version.

Thanks also to everyone who participated with their cool ideas and feedback, and also big thanks to the CSS-Next group
for being so welcoming and helpful, and choosing my proposal as the final candidate!

You can view and download the final version in different formats (images, SVG, CSS, etc.) on
