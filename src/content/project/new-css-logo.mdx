I created a modern CSS Logo design, and proposed it to the
[CSS-Next community group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2023Nov/att-0002/CSS-Next_Community_Group.pdf),
a part of the W3C.

The design includes many hat tips to CSS and web design:

- Subtle rounded corners, making the logo resemble a tooltip / eye dropper / popup element.
- Uses a known web color, <span class="text-[hotpink] font-mono">hotpink</span>. The color choice represents a color
  from the JS logo tetradic scale. Pink is also often related to makeup ðŸ’…, and CSS is the makeup of the web!
- The CSS version of the logo uses modern CSS features, like `font-variant` and `@container` queries.

It also meets the following criteria:

- Works well without color, in white and black.
- Works with and without a version number (contains enough space to fit one).
- It's legible and recognizable, in small and large sizes.
- It's recognizable by color and shape, even if the text is too small (e.g. 12px and below).
- It can be represented in both SVG and CSS-only formats.
- It works well with existing community logos (JS, WebAssembly, etc) and brands (like Typescript).
