I created a modern CSS Logo design, and proposed it to the
[CSS-Next community group](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2023Nov/att-0002/CSS-Next_Community_Group.pdf),
a part of the W3C.

The design includes many nods to CSS and web design:

- Subtle rounded corners, making the logo resemble a tooltip / eye dropper / popup element. Referencing two of the
  things that were once hard to style in pure CSS: rounded corners and popovers. Now thanks to new specs like
  [Anchor Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning), that's easier than
  ever.
- The CSS version of the logo uses modern CSS features, like `font-variant` and `@container` queries.
- Uses known web colors, like <span class="bg-[hotpink] text-black p-1 font-mono">hotpink</span> (original proposal) or
  <span class="bg-[rebeccapurple] text-white p-1 font-mono">rebeccapurple</span> (final version).

It also meets the following criteria:

- Works well without color, in white and black.
- Works with and without a version number (contains enough space to fit one).
- It's legible and recognizable, in small and large sizes.
- It's recognizable by color and shape, even if the text is too small (e.g. 12px and below).
- It can be represented in both SVG and CSS-only formats.
- It works well with existing community logos (JS, WebAssembly, etc) and brands (like Typescript).

## Final version

In the final version we opted to use an Open Source font: [Dinish Condensed Heavy](https://github.com/playbeing/dinish).

The Working Group also preferred the <span class="bg-[rebeccapurple] text-white p-1 font-mono">rebeccapurple</span>
color over hotpink, another known web color but with a beautiful and
[meaningful story behind it](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2014/06/19/rebeccapurple/).

After a [popular vote](https://github.com/CSS-Next/css-next/issues/105#issuecomment-2445341089), and also considering
blue colors, the community chose `rebeccapurple` with 420+ votes in favor.

Special thanks to [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/) for helping me with the different iterations of the logo, with the
HTML/CSS version, and helping with the community feedback and final version.

Thanks also to everyone who participated with their cool ideas and feedback, and also big thanks to the CSS-Next group
for being so welcoming and helpful, and choosing my proposal as the final candidate!

You can view and download the final version in different formats (images, SVG, CSS, etc.) on
[Github](https://github.com/CSS-Next/logo.css).
