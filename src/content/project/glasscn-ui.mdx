## Features

This package includes most of the shadcn/ui components bundled in a single component library, with the following changes:

2. Improved color options and management: Additional color aliases and easier color switching. More consistent color
   usage, specially with gray and primary/accent colors.
3. New components like CircularProgress, ComboBox, DotIndicator, and HeadingTitle.
4. Improved button styles and variants, with more colors.
5. Enhanced toast notifications.
