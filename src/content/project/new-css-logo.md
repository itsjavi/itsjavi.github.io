I worked on the redesigned CSS Logo, proposed to the CSS-Next community group, a part of the W3C.

The design includes many hat tips to CSS like rounded corners, and elements like tooltips and color pickers.

The chosen web color is hotpink, which is the closest to the pink in the JS logo tetradic. Pink is also often related to
makeup ðŸ’…, because CSS is the makeup of the web!
