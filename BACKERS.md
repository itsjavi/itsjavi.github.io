The ongoing development of all open source projects by [Javi Aguilar](https://github.com/itsjavi) like
 [Farbelous](https://github.com/farbelous) and [Capsule Monsters](https://github.com/capsulemonsters) is possible 
entirely thanks to the support of these awesome backers.

If you'd like to join them and **be featured in the websites of the most popular projects**, please consider:

- [üéÅ One-time donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/metaunicorn?locale.x=en_US).


A big thank you to all backers, sponsors and one-time donors! üôè , your support makes it easier for me to bring 
more quality and new features to the projects and create new ones, while also covering the expenses they generate (domains,  services, software licenses, etc).
